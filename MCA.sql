###Task 6: Determine the conversion volume achieved by each marketing channel.
  ### Query the joined tables to summarize users converted by each channel.


select c.Channel, sum(e.Conversions) as Total_Conversion
from campaigns as c
join engagement as e 
on c.Campaign_ID = e.Campaign_ID
group by c.Channel
order by c.Channel desc;


##Task 7: Identify the top-performing campaigns(channels) based on return metrics.
## Calculate each campaignâ€™s return by comparing spending to revenue.

select c.Campaign_ID,c.Budget,(r.New_User_Revenue + r.Returning_User_Revenue) AS Total_Revenue, 
		((r.New_User_Revenue + r.Returning_User_Revenue) / c.Budget) * 100 AS RoI
from revenue as r 
join campaigns as c 
on r.Campaign_ID = c.Campaign_ID 
order by RoI DESC
